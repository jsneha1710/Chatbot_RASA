  A team willing to participate in this event can have a minimum of 1 and maximum of 3 members.\n
  The event will consist of two stages. Stage-1 will be conducted on (Day-0) at sharp 4:30pm and will end at 6:00pm and Stage-2 will be starting on (Day-0) at sharp 9:00pm and will end at 11:59am at (Day-2).\n
  The registered teams need to submit the solutions and report. A knowledge of  Boolean algebra, logic gates, digital circuit elements is a prerequisite.\n
  Final Judging will be based on total marks obtained in stage-1 and stage-2 (stage-1 i.e. 30% and stage-2 i.e. 70%). \n

  utter_Fiducia:
  - text: "Fiducia Workshop details : Due to their large and complex attack surface and the difficulty in ensuring they are secure, web applications continue to be a prime target in attacks.\n
   All it takes is a flaw in the application itself, its framework, the web server or proxy server configuration, or even some third-party component \n
   (e.g. a JavaScript library that is embedded on each web page) to lead to a full compromise of a host or network. In this session, we will talk both\n
    generally about the trends in web application security and look at specific examples of how key vulnerabilities arise , paying particular attention to those more subtle cases that usually go under the radar,\n
    such as within HTML5 applications. The webinar will also explore hacking scenarios based on real-world examples. For more information contact : Kaushal : 8669132952 or Hashir : 9913759592"

    We’ll start off with a theoretical brief about Linux, what all it can do, and why it’s useful.\n
    The participants will be guided through a process of installing Windows Subsystem for Linux, to enable them to use the Linux terminal, even on Windows.\n
    The basic commands will be covered first. More complex commands will follow, which enable us to solve problems using the command line.\n
    Debugging will be discussed side by side.It will be a live hands-on workshop, conducted on Zoom.\n
